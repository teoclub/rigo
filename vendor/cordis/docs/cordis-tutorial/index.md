# Cordis tutorial

English | [中文](index.zh.md)

Cordis is the plugin framework underneath DeepSeek Harness: a small runtime where every capability — tools, LLM adapters, file access, the agent loop itself — is a plugin mounted into a shared context. This tutorial teaches Cordis hands-on. Chapters 1–6 are runnable examples adapted to `@teoclub/*`; chapter 7 retains the original DeepSeek Harness integration context.

The audience is agent developers. You do not need deep TypeScript experience; the [TypeScript notes](#typescript-notes) below explain the syntax that may be unfamiliar, and every chapter shows the exact commands and expected output.

If you want a condensed concept reference instead of a walkthrough, read the
[architecture guide](../architecture.md). The detailed framework reference
lives in the [Cordis core API](../cordis-api/context.md) pages.

To write plugins for DeepSeek Harness itself, start from the
[upstream Harness plugin guide](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness/blob/b150a551b8d465e31e418e1b2eaf5e79bbb7d28e/docs/user/develop/basic/index.md).

## Setup

From this repository's root, install dependencies and build the workspace.
No API key is needed for chapters 1–6.

```sh
bun install
bun run build
```

Create the scratch directory the chapters work in. `tmp/` is gitignored, so nothing you write there touches version control:

```sh
mkdir -p tmp/cordis-tutorial
cd tmp/cordis-tutorial
```

Every chapter runs the same command from this directory:

```sh
bun ../../packages/cordis/bin.js
```

That one-file launcher (see
[`packages/cordis/bin.js`](../../packages/cordis/bin.js)) creates a root
`Context`, mounts the Loader plugin, and tells it to load `./cordis.yml` from
the current directory. Everything else — which plugins exist and how they are
configured — comes from that YAML file. Bun loads the TypeScript plugin files
used throughout the tutorial directly.

## Chapters

1. [Your first plugin](01-first-plugin.md) — a plugin is a function; the loader mounts it.
2. [Lifecycle and effects](02-lifecycle-and-effects.md) — Cordis-managed registrations are undone when their plugin unloads.
3. [Services](03-services.md) — expose a capability on `ctx` and depend on it with `inject`.
4. [Events](04-events.md) — typed events, broadcast dispatch, and the waterfall short-circuit.
5. [Configuration](05-config.md) — validated config from `cordis.yml`, failing loud on bad input.
6. [Composition and HMR](06-composition-and-hmr.md) — the config file as a plugin tree, hot reload, and diagnosing a plugin that never loads.
7. [Into the harness](07-into-the-harness.md) — register a model-callable tool against real harness services.

## TypeScript notes

The examples use three TypeScript features beyond ordinary modern JavaScript:

- **Type annotations** describe values without changing runtime behavior: `ctx: Context` says that `ctx` has the Cordis context API, `who: string` accepts text, and `string[]` means an array of strings.
- **`import type { Context } from '@teoclub/cordis'`** imports only type information. It vanishes at runtime, so a plugin file that needs `Context` solely for annotations adds no runtime dependency.
- **Declaration merging** (`declare module '@teoclub/cordis' { ... }`) adds your entries to interfaces that Cordis already declares — for example the type of a new `ctx.greeter` property or event name. It generates no runtime wiring; the plugin separately provides the service or emits the event. Chapter 3 shows the pattern in full.

Chapter 5 also uses an `interface` to describe a configuration object's fields and a generic type such as `Schema<Config>` to say which object fields a schema validates. You can copy those declarations as shown; the surrounding text explains what each one connects.
